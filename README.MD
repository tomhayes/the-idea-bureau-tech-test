#The Idea Bureau Tech Test - Tom Hayes

A simple HTML tech test for The Idea Bureau. 

Not a tonne of stuff to add here - there's no installation or anything to handle as it's flat HTML/CSS. 

I've used BEM CSS (though there's no modularity/preprocessing involved as the complexity of the project didn't warrant it).

Thanks for reading!
